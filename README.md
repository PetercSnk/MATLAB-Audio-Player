Probably won't get round to updating it, do what you want with it.

Audio files are stored in source/audio, thumbnails are stored in source/cover.
Ensure the thumbnail has the same name as audio file excluding the file extension.
Some examples are provided in the directories.
Do not delete default.jpg.
